# User Defined File/Folder Organizer
A smart file-organizer to move files of similar type to their designated folder. 

- Put the file extensions and folder names you want in **fileFolder.xlsx**
- Run the **groupFiles.py** and wait a few seconds
- You may check the **logfile.txt** to know the whereabouts of the folders and files

Note: Keep the **fileFolder.xlsx** and **groupFiles.py** in the same folder as the other files when running.
